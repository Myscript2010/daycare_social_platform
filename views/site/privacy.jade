h3#introduction 1. Introduction

p Scope. This privacy policy covers all of XXX. It does not, however, apply to entities that XXX does not own or control, such as applications and websites using Platform. By using or accessing XXX, you agree to our privacy practices outlined.
p No information from children under age 13. If you are under age 13, please do not attempt to register for XXX or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us through this.
p Parental participation. We strongly recommend that minors 13 years of age or older ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices. Materials to help parents talk to their children about safe internet use can be found on this help page.

h3#information 2. Information We Receive

p Information you provide to us:
p Information About Yourself. When you sign up for XXX you provide us with your name, email. During the registration process we give you the opportunity to connect with your kindergardens, and other parents. You will also be able to add a picture of yourself. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. Once you register you can provide other information about yourself by connecting with, for example, your current city, hometown, activities, interests, and places. You can also upload a photo and add a description to it.
p Content. One of the primary reasons people use XXX is to find out information about the kindergardens and share content/ connect with parents. Examples include when you update your status, upload or take a photo, create an event or a group, make a comment, write something on a Wall, write a note, or send someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with content you share on XXX (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content.
p Information we collect when you interact with XXX:
p Site activity information. We keep track of some of the actions you take on XXX, such as adding connections (including joining a group or adding a friend), creating a photo album/group, attending an event. In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide information or content to us. For example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact that you shared it.
p Access Device and Browser Information. When you access XXX from a computer, mobile phone, or other device, we may collect information from that device about your browser type, location, and IP address, as well as the pages you visit.
p Information we receive from third parties:
p Kindzy Platform. We do not own or operate the applications or websites that you use through XXX Platform (such as games and utilities). Whenever you connect with a Platform application or website, we will receive information from them, including information about actions you take. In some cases, in order to personalize the process of connecting, we may receive a limited amount of information even before you connect with the application or website.
p Information from other users. We may collect information about you from other XXX users, such as you participate in a discussion or join a kindergarden.

h3#protect 3. How We Protect Information
p Kindzy  is committed to earning and keeping your trust and we understand the need to keep your information secure and private. As a result we have implemented industry-recognized safeguards to protect your information. These safeguards include:
p Kindzy web site is secure. We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer), the industry standard method for computers to communicate securely without risk of manipulation or recipient impersonation. We utilize SSL in the online registration process, in the login process, and in the account management section of the Site.
p Kindzy uses encryption technology to protect sensitive information such as credit card information, date of birth, and information related to background checks.
p Kindzy employs firewalls and system monitoring to protect against unauthorized access of our systems.
p We do our best to keep your information secure, but we need your help
p Steps we take to keep your information secure. We keep your account information on a secured server behind a firewall. We also use automated and social measures to enhance security, such as analyzing account behavior for fraudulent or otherwise anomalous behavior, may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse, may remove inappropriate content or links to illegal content.
p Risks inherent in sharing information . We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you share your information. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We cannot ensure that information you share on XXX will not become publicly available. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures on XXX. You can reduce these risks by using common sense security practices such as choosing a strong password, using different passwords for different services, and using up to date antivirus software.
p Report Violations. You should report any security violations to us on this help page.

h3#changes 4. Privacy Policy Changes
p This Privacy Policy may change, from time to time, due to changes on our Site, legal developments, business factors and ever-changing technology. Notifications to changes of our Privacy Policy will be posted on our Site, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
